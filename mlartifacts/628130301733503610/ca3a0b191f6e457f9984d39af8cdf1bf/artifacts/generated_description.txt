Women's casual tunic blouse in deep navy blue. Lightweight woven (chambray-like) fabric with a soft matte finish. V-shaped split neckline with short buttoned placket and subtle stand collar. Vertical pintuck seams down the front add tailored detail. Three-quarter sleeves finished with roll-tab and button; relaxed, slightly A-line cut that falls to hip length with a gently curved hem and side slits. Solid color, no print — contemporary, casual everyday style.
