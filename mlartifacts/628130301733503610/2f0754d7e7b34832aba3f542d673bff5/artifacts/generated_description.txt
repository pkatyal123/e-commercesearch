Women's knee-length tunic/kurta in a soft ivory/cream tone. Straight, relaxed silhouette with a round neckline and a short center slit; long sleeves with simple finished cuffs. Made from a lightweight woven fabric with a subtle textured look and tone-on-tone embroidered detailing down the front panel and around the neckline, creating a delicate linear pattern. Minimal, elegant styling with small side slits at the hem — suited to casual or smart-casual ethnic wear. No bold prints or contrasting trims; overall a clean, monochromatic, understated piece.
