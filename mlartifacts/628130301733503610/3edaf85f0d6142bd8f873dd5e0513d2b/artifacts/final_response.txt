Recommended best fit
- If you need a running-style shoe from this set, pick Test Product 31972 — it matches the running/trainer silhouette and materials, though it is grey/blue with a turquoise sole, not red.
- If color (red) is essential, none of these items meet your requirement.

Next steps I can take for you
- Search the catalog specifically for "red" or filter by base_colour = red to find true red running shoes.
- Show similar running-style shoes in other colors or set an alert if red sizes come in later.
- If you tell me size, gender, or price range, I can narrow results faster.
