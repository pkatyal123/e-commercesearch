Short answer: There are no exact matches for "red running shoes" in the catalog you provided. The closest match by style/use is product 31972 (a low‑top athletic running/trainer), but it is gray/teal/blue rather than red.

Summary of the items found:
- Product 31972 — Low‑top lace‑up athletic running/training sneaker (streamlined, lightweight). Colors: medium heather gray upper, teal/turquoise midsole, deep blue outsole, navy accents. Best match by purpose (running) but not red.
- Product 15334 — Men’s athletic shorts (black with neon piping). Apparel, not footwear.
- Product 13353 — Men’s closed‑toe sport sandal (tan/nubuck). Footwear but sandal, not a running shoe and not red.
- Product 2255 — Athletic/track pants (black with piping). Apparel, not footwear.
- Product 26548 — Children’s low‑top canvas sneaker (navy with white toe cap). Shoe but kids’ casual style and navy, not red.

Recommendation:
- If you want "running shoes" regardless of color: choose Test Product 31972 (ID 31972). It matches the running/training silhouette and features you likely want (lightweight, breathable knit, cushioned midsole).
- If color (red) is essential: there are no red running shoes in this set. I recommend refining the search with a color filter (color = red) and category = Footwear or sub_category = Sneakers/Running, or asking me to search the broader catalog/other inventories for red running sneakers. I can also set an alert or suggest similar silhouettes available in other colorways if you’d like.

Tell me which you prefer — prioritize style/use or color — and I’ll continue searching.
