Compact structured top-handle satchel in a warm champagne‑beige/metallic cream tone. Smooth, glossy body contrasted by a snakeskin‑embossed flap and matching textured trim for a two‑tone effect. Short rolled double handles, gold‑tone metal nameplate/closure on the front, neat topstitching and a slightly rounded rectangular silhouette — a small, polished handbag suitable for dressy or everyday use.
